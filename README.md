# Robinfish Interpreter
This is a [Deadfish](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Deadfish) [Interpreter](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/introduction-to-interpreters/) & Terminal written in [C++20](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/20). (Overkill? Maybe.) It contains various other operators from a smattering of Deadfish extensions as well as a few original ones.

It supports ``.df`` and ``.txt`` files both dropped or specified, as well as a terminal mode when the application is directly opened.

## Building
This interpreter exists entirely within a source code file and a single library, so building should be trivial with any program.

## License
This interpreter and its source code are provided under the [MIT License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).
